# SaltThePass Manager

- Basic description of project
- Credit original project & site
- Current status

## To-Do

- Proguard on Desktop fails. This still needs to be addressed.
- Add a way to move the stored-accounts file to a user-defined location.
  This would allow users to synchronize stored accounts between devices.
  - One possible extension to this would be to password-protect the file as well.

## Credits

- The original [SaltThePass](https://saltthepass.com) by [Nic Jansma](https://nicj.net/).
  This project uses the same algorithm and a similarly designed UI.
  Additionally, some text from the original SaltThePass was adapted into this project's help UI.
- GitHub Material Icon from [Pictogrammers](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/).
- Logic for opening the default browser on Desktop is based on the answer at https://stackoverflow.com/a/68426773.
